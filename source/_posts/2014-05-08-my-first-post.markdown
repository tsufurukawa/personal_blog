####A Little About Me

I'm a basketball guy. I love playing ball, I love watching the Lakers, and I love playing fantasy basketball. In fact I love basketball so much that I'm doing just that as I'm writing this blog - watching Game 2 of Portland vs. San Antonio series. Well, it turns out my sentiments towards programming is just about the opposite. Or more precisely, it *was*. When I took my first progamming class 6 years ago, I was so lost, so frustrated and so annoyed, that I ended up with a C in the class. Granted, it was a C++ course, which by far is the hardest language I've ever learned (let's face it, it's like Ruby on steroids), but to a guy who's never seen that infamous letter all throughout his educational career, getting a C was as big a surprise as the Spurs losing Game 6 of last year's NBA finals. Pardon me if I sounded a bit nerdy there. Point is, programming and I were like oil and water. We just didn't mix.  

But here I am today, 5 weeks into an online Ruby on Rails Bootcamp called Tealeaf Academy. And quite frankly, I'm loving every second of it. How I got here is a whole another story of it's own, but dedicating myself to learn web development is one of the best decisions I've ever made. In this short amount of time, Tealeaf has already provided me with a foundational knowledge in Ruby, web development, Rails, and more importantly, an appreciation, and at times enjoyment, for the art of coding. In 5 weeks!! Crazy!! And the journey's just begun. 

This blog is to record the random tidbits of knowlege that I acquire from this course. I'm hoping this acts as not only a mnemonic device for myself, but also as an yearbook of some sort - something I can look back on ten years from now and reminisce about how ignorant I was and realize how much I have grown since those days. We'll see how dedicated I am in keeping this blog up-to-date, but I'm genuinely excited to see how my career as a web developer will unfold. 

####Aside

I'm actually a big quote guy as well. Here is a quote that really reasonates with me, by the great Mahatma Gandhi and popularized by the equally great Coach John Wooden.
