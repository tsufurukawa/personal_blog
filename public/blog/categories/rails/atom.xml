    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the last post, we discussed how to generate forms, how the parameters are stored inside a <code>params</code> hash, and where the form is submitted to. In this post, we talk about how to handle the form submission using validations and strong parameters.</p>

<h4>Strong Parameters</h4>

<p>Strong parameters is a security feature that protects attributes from end-user mass assignment. Quoting the <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/StrongParameters.html">Rails API</a>,</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With strong parameters, Action Controller parameters are forbidden to be used in Active Model mass assignments until they have been whitelisted.</p></blockquote>

<p>This means that we manually specify which attributes are allowed for mass updating. To whitelist an entire hash of parameters, the <code>permit!</code> method can be used: <code>params.require(:post).permit!</code>. The <code>require(:post)</code> suggests that the attributes are nested inside a <code>post</code> top-level key (which as we recall, is what we get using model-backed forms).</p>

<h4>Validations</h4>

<p>Next, validations are used to ensure that only valid data is saved into our database. For example, if every post must have <code>title</code>, <code>url</code>, and <code>description</code> attributes for the post to be valid, we must explicitly specify the validation on the <em>Model Layer</em>. Such validations might look like this:</p>

<p><code>ruby Ex 1: Post Model Validation
class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :title, presence: true, length: { minimum: 5 }
  validates :url, presence: true, uniqueness: true
  validates :description, presence: true
end
</code></p>

<p>An important aspect of validation is that the errors are not triggered until the changes hit the database. This means that when creating a new <code>post</code> object, the validation errors will kick in after a <code>.create</code> <code>.update</code> or <code>.save</code> methods are called on <code>Post</code> (but not <code>.new</code>). If validations are successful, the assignment will return true, and otherwise, it will return false.</p>

<h4>Validation Pattern</h4>

<p>When creating the <code>create</code> / <code>update</code> actions from a model-backed form, we use a generalized pattern to handle the validations.</p>

<p>```ruby Ex 2: Validation Pattern (app/controllers/posts_controller.rb)
def create
  @post = Post.new(post_params)</p>

<p>  if @post.save</p>

<pre><code>flash[:notice] = "You successfully created a new post."
redirect_to posts_path
</code></pre>

<p>  else</p>

<pre><code>render :new
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<p>def update
  @post = Post.find(params[:id])</p>

<p>  if @post.update(post_params)</p>

<pre><code>flash[:notice] = "You successfully updated an existing post."
redirect_to posts_path
</code></pre>

<p>  else</p>

<pre><code>render :edit
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<p>private</p>

<p>def post_params
  params.require(:post).permit(:title, :url, :description)
end
```</p>

<p>There are a variety of interesting things going on here. First, we defined a private method called <code>post_params</code> which sets up the strong parameters as we discussed earlier. Inside the <code>create</code> and <code>update</code> actions, we call <code>post_params</code> to mass assign parameters to the <code>@post</code> object. Second, if the validation is successful, we <code>redirect_to</code> to <code>posts_path</code>. We can actually redirect to wherever we desire, but in this case, we are redirecting to <code>posts#index</code> action where we display all posts. Lastly and perhaps most importantly, if the validation is unsuccessful, we <code>render</code> the form template. This is VERY important!! We CANNOT redirect because if validation fails, we want to display the error messages in the <code>view</code>. This is only possible when we render because the error message is stored inside an instance variable <code>@post.errors</code>. If we redirect, we lose access to that instance variable because we&rsquo;re issuing another HTTP request (HTTP is a <em>stateless</em> protocol).</p>

<p>The <code>.errors</code> method will return a <code>@messages</code> hash that contains all validation error messages. We can extract these messages into an array-like structure using the <code>.errors.full_messages</code> method. We can then iterate through these messages and display them inside our view template:</p>

<p>```erb Ex 3: Displaying Validation Errors
&lt;%= if @post.errors.any? %>
  <h5>There were some errors:</h5>
  <ul></p>

<pre><code>&lt;% @post.errors.full_messages.each do |msg| %&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= msg %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>  </ul>
&lt;% end %>
```</p>

<p>Notice here that we are using the <code>@post</code> object. This is again why it is important that we render (instead of redirect) when validation fails, because we need to access the <code>@post</code> instance variable and its associated <code>.errors</code>.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>Strong parameters and validations work hand-in-hand within the generalized validation pattern. Rails form is one of the fundamental concepts of the framework and should not be taken for granted. As a Rails developer, it&rsquo;s VERY important to be able to construct and handle forms with ease. You should be able to do it blindfolded, with your hands tied behind your back, and in your sleep. It&rsquo;s THAT important!!!</p>

    <id>http://tsufurukawa-blog.herokuapp.com/blog/2014/05/13/rails-forms</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In general, there are 3 ways to create and handle forms in Rails: pure html, form helpers, and model-backed form helpers.</p>

<h4>Pure HTML Way</h4>

<p>The pure html way is just that &ndash; pure HTML. So it really has nothing to do with Rails. This approach is shown in the code below:</p>

<p><code>html Ex 1: Form Using Pure HTML
&lt;form action='/posts' method='POST'&gt;
  Title: &lt;input typ='text' name='my_title'&gt;
  &lt;input type='submit'&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></p>

<p>The <code>action</code> and <code>method</code> attributes specify the URL and HTTP verb used for the form submission. In other words, the form will be routed to <code>posts#create</code>, which is the action in which the form submission data is parsed and processed to create a new <code>post</code> object. It is important to specify the <code>name</code> attribute inside <code>input</code> because it acts as the key that maps to the value entered in the text field (eg: <code>"my_title" =&gt; "some title"</code>). We can then recover that value by using the params hash like so: <code>params[:my_title]</code>.</p>

<p>Submitting this form will actually result in an <code>InvalidAuthenticityToken Error</code> because of a security issue with cross-site scripting. Rails requires us to verify that the form was submitted from a page we generated, which is accomplished by the presence of an <code>authenticity_token</code>. Since the pure html way does not have an authenticity token built in, we should almost always avoid using this method to handle form submission.</p>

<h4>Rails Non-Model Backed Form Helpers</h4>

<p>The second method is using Non-Model Backed Forrm Helpers. The syntax is shown below:</p>

<p><code>erb Ex 2: Form Using Non-Model Backed Form Helpers
&lt;%= form_tag '/posts' do %&gt;
  &lt;%= label_tag :title %&gt;
  &lt;%= text_field_tag :title %&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;%= submit_tag "Create Post", class: 'btn btn-primary'%&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;  
</code></p>

<p>The above code will generate an html like this:</p>

<p>```html Ex 3: HTML Generated Using Rails Form Helperes</p>

<div style="margin:0;padding:0;display:inline">
  <input name="utf8" type="hidden" value="✓">
  <input name="authenticity_token" type="hidden" value="d/fqhgShsPjPL+Mxslr6fwj4rCbLVMkndsJ1M3DJPiY=">
</div>


<p><label for="title">Title</label>
<input id="title" name="title" type="text">
<input class="btn btn-primary" name="commit" type="submit" value="Create Post">
```</p>

<p>As before, we have a <code>name</code> attribute that maps to the value submitted in the text field. But notice we also have a <code>div</code> nestsed inside the <code>form</code> element. Inside this <code>div</code>, we have a hidden <code>authenticity_token</code> that allows us to get around the Cross-Site Requeset Forgery (CSRF) protection that comes with Rails.</p>

<h4>Rails Model-Backed Form Helpers</h4>

<p>Lastly, we have the model-backed form helpers. These are used when performing &ldquo;CRUD&rdquo; actions on a resource (i.e. ActiveRecord model); whereas, non-model backed forms are used everywhere else where ActiveRecord models are not involved. The syntax is shown below:</p>

<p><code>erb Ex 4: Form Using Model-Backed Form Helpers
&lt;%= form_for @post do |f| %&gt;
  &lt;%= f.label :title %&gt;
  &lt;%= f.text_field :title %&gt;
  &lt;%= f.label :description %&gt;
  &lt;%= f.text_area :description %&gt;
  &lt;%= f.submit "Create Post", class: "btn btn-primary" %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></p>

<p>There are a couple of interesting (and confusing) conventions at work that makes model-backed forms so useful. First, the <code>form_for</code> takes in a model object instead of a url &ndash; and this is where Rails magic kicks in. If the object is a new object, Rails will send the form to the <code>posts#create</code> action; whereas, if the object is an existing one, Rails will send the form to the <code>posts#update</code> action. In other words, Rails will automatically generate the correct URL and HTTP verb depending on the model object that is passed in to the form. This may sound trivial at first, but this implies that we can use the same form for two different controller actions &ndash; one for <code>new</code> where we pass in a new <code>post</code> object, and one for <code>edit</code> where we pass in an existing <code>post</code> object.</p>

<p>The second interesting feature is that the input element has a name of <code>post[title]</code>, meaning the parameters are nested inside a top-level key of <code>post</code>, as shown here: <code>"post" =&gt; {"title": "some title", "description": "some description"}</code>. We can then do something like this, <code>Post.new(params[:post])</code> to mass assign all attributes values to create a new post.</p>

<p>Lastly, as the name &ldquo;model-backed&rdquo; implies, we can ONLY refer to <em>Attributes</em> or <em>Virtual Attributes</em> available to us by the ActiveRecord model. Therefore, we cannot use arbitrary keys that do not reside in our database. For example, <code>&lt;%= f.text_field :whatever %&gt;</code> will not work because <code>whatever</code> is not a getter/setter that is made available to us by the <code>Post</code> model. This is also why model-backed helpers are used when acting on a resource, and non-model backed helpers are used everywhere else.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>To summarize the above in one sentence: never use pure HTML forms, use model-backed forms when working with an ActiveRecord model, and use non model-backed forms for all other occassions. In the next post, we will discuss how to handle the actual submission of the form using strong parameters and validations.</p>

    <updated>2014-05-09T11:38:40-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://tsufurukawa-blog.herokuapp.com/blog/2014/05/09/part-ii</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the previous post we saw that we can pass in a file name such as <code>shared/content_file</code> into a partial, which will then render the <code>_content_file.html.erb</code> file allowing us to create content that is shared among many pages in our application. We can also pass in a local variable such as <code>title</code>, containing dynamic data that changes depending on what value we assign to the variable.</p>

<h4>Rendering Model Instances</h4>

<p>Things can get quite interesting when we pass in model instances to the partial. An example is taken from <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html">Rails Guide</a>. Here <code>@customer</code> is an instance of the <code>Customer</code> model, which could&rsquo;ve been defined somewhere in the <code>CustomersController</code> like this <code>@customer = Customer.first</code>.</p>

<p><code>erb Ex 1: Rendering Instance Objects (Simplified Way)
&lt;%= render @customer %&gt;
</code></p>

<p>This code will render the partial <code>_customer.html.erb</code> inside <code>views/customers/customer</code> and will &ldquo;pass the local variable <code>customer</code> into the partial which will refer to the <code>@customer</code> in the parent view.&rdquo; Sounds complicated? Well yes, because it is! Essentially the above can be replaced by the following code, with syntax that we are slightly more familiar with.</p>

<p><code>erb Ex 2: Rendering Instance Objects (Explicit Way)
&lt;%= render 'customers/customer', customer: @customer %&gt;  
</code></p>

<p>By convention, when we pass in a model instance to a partial, Rails expects the partial to be named after the model (preceded with an underscore) placed inside a directory with a lowercase plural form of the model name (i.e. <code>customers</code>) &ndash; and this is precisely what we see in <em>Ex 2</em>. For the second argument, Rails created a local variable (named after the object model), and set it to the <code>@customer</code> instance variable. In a nutshell, Ex 1 is what we call <em>syntactic sugar</em> that saves us a few extra keystrokes.</p>

<h4>Rendering Collections (Array of Objects)</h4>

<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s say we have an array of objects (aka <em>collection</em>) that we would like to pass in to a partial, so that we can render content dynamically based on data encapsulated within the individual objects. Here is how we might initially approach this problem.</p>

<p><code>erb Ex 3: Rendering Collections (Long Way)
&lt;% categories = Category.all %&gt;
&lt;% categories.each do |category| %&gt;
  &lt;%= render 'categories/category', category: category %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></p>

<p>```erb Ex 4: Inside Partial (located inside app/views/categories/_category.html.erb)</p>

<p><p>This is the category name that changes depending on the objects that are passed in: &lt;%= category.name %></p>
```</p>

<p>By now, Ex 3 should be fairly comprehensible. <code>categories</code> is a collection of <code>category</code> instances. We iterate through the collection, and for every iteration, we render the partial while passing in the <code>category</code> local variable. Then inside the partial template, we can use the <code>category</code> local variable and extract attributes such as <code>name</code> from the object that the local variable is referencing.</p>

<p>Just like everything else in Rails, it turns out there is a shorthand syntax for this.</p>

<p><code>erb Ex 5: Rendering Collections (Short Way)
&lt;%= categories = Category.all %&gt;
&lt;%= render categories %&gt;
</code></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it!!! Nice and clean. First, Rails recognizes that <code>categories</code> is a collection of objects from the <code>Category</code> model. Second, Rails determines the name of the partial to use by looking at the model name in the collection. Lastly, Rails allows access to each member of the collection, within individual instances of the partial, by assigning each member to a local variable named after the partial. Hence, the code in Ex 5 is entirely identical to the one in Ex 3. Rails Magic!!</p>

<h4>Aside</h4>

<p>Here is another quote I like that I once heard from Jeff Van Gundy, color commentator for ESPN. It turns out thoough, it was originally quoted by Ralph Waldo Emerson.</p>

<blockquote><p>“Your actions speak so loudly, I cannot hear what you are saying.”

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4>Some Basic Rails Conventions</h4>

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s talk Rails. Rails is&hellip;interesting, to say the least. It&rsquo;s only been a week since I&rsquo;ve been exposed to the core ideology behind Rails, so I am far from knowing the ins and outs of the language. Rails is centered around the paradigm of <em>Convention Over Configuration</em>, which in layman&rsquo;s terms &ndash; follow the convention and you&rsquo;ll be grateful, and you&rsquo;re screwed if you don&rsquo;t. I think these conventions are what makes everything in Rails seem so magical, while simultaneously confusing. Until you wrap your head around the fact that a lot goes behind the scenes and some things you just have to take for granted, learning Rails could be quite a challenge.</p>

<p>Here, I present some crazy conventions that I encountered and initially had difficult time digesting; thus, I deemed important to take note.</p>

<p>In Rails (or any MVC framework for that matter), the <em>View</em> contains the content that will be rendered and returned to the browser as part of the HTTP response. An example erb template and the controller that renders the template, are shown below:</p>

<p><code>erb Example ERB Template Under app/views/posts/index.html.erb
&lt;%= @posts.each do |post| %&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Title: &lt;%= post.title %&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Description: &lt;%= post.description %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></p>

<p>``` ruby Posts Controller that Renders the View Template Above
class PostsController &lt; ApplicationController
  def index</p>

<pre><code>@posts = Post.all
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>Here the <code>PostsController</code> is extracting all <code>Post</code> instances stored in the database called <code>posts</code> (named in such way by convention) and storing it in an instance variable called <code>@posts</code> allowing the erb template to access the data without directly communicating with the Model / Database layer. The template can then iterate through the <code>post</code> objects and display the data contained within those objects (which are essentially table rows when speaking on the database layer). So far, so good.</p>

<p>Every controller action maps to a respective view template (unless of course we redirect instead of render), so as an application grows in complexity, we can expect for code to get cluttered and we often find ourselves repeating the same code in multiple files. It turns out, we can create special templates called <em>partial</em>, in which we can embed the repetitive code. We can then <em>pull in</em> the partial from multiple files whenever we seek to access its content. A code is worth a million words, so here is an example:</p>

<p>``` erb Pulling In a Partial Inside app/views/posts/index.html.erb</p>

<p>This is my main content template, and I'm going to pull in the partial on the next line.</p>




<!-- Pull in the partial -->


<p>&lt;%= render &lsquo;shared/content_title&rsquo;, title: &lsquo;All Posts&rsquo; %></p>

<p>This paragraph will be rendered after the partial content</p>


<p>
```</p>

<p>``` erb The Partial That&rsquo;s Being Called Inside app/views/shared/_content_title.html.erb</p>

<h4>This is a Partial</h4>


<p><p>&lt;%= title %></p>
```</p>

<p>All partial files are named with a preceding underscore (again by convention), but strangely enough whenever we render the partial, it is called without the underscore, as shown by the top code. We are also passing a local variable <code>title</code> into the partial, which allows us to render code across multiple files that is similar in structure, but varies in content. Specifically, we can call this partial from any view file (such as show.html.erb or edit.html.erb), and by passing in different values for <code>title</code> we can render dynamic content while maintaining the structure of having the single <code>h4</code> and <code>p</code> tags.</p>

<h4>To Be Continued</h4>

<p>Since this post is getting WAAAY longer than I anticipated, I will continue this discussion on partials and how Rails convention can get a little convoluted on the next post.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4>A Little About Me</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;m a basketball guy. I love playing ball, I love watching the Lakers, and I love playing fantasy basketball. In fact I love basketball so much that I&rsquo;m doing just that as I&rsquo;m writing this blog &ndash; watching Game 2 of Portland vs. San Antonio series. Well, it turns out my sentiments towards programming is just about the opposite. Or more precisely, it <em>was</em>. When I took my first progamming class 6 years ago, I was so lost, so frustrated and so annoyed, that I ended up with a C in the class. Granted, it was a C++ course, which by far is the hardest language I&rsquo;ve ever learned (let&rsquo;s face it, it&rsquo;s like Ruby on steroids), but to a guy who&rsquo;s never seen that infamous letter all throughout his educational career, getting a C was as big a surprise as the Spurs losing Game 6 of last year&rsquo;s NBA finals. Pardon me if I sounded a bit nerdy there. Point is, programming and I were like oil and water. We just didn&rsquo;t mix.</p>

<p>But here I am today, 5 weeks into an online Ruby on Rails Bootcamp called Tealeaf Academy. And quite frankly, I&rsquo;m loving every second of it. How I got here is a whole another story of it&rsquo;s own, but dedicating myself to learn web development is one of the best decisions I&rsquo;ve ever made. In this short amount of time, Tealeaf has already provided me with a foundational knowledge in Ruby, web development, Rails, and more importantly, an appreciation, and at times enjoyment, for the art of coding. In 5 weeks!! Crazy!! And the journey&rsquo;s just begun.</p>

<p>This blog is to record the random tidbits of knowlege that I acquire from this course. I&rsquo;m hoping this acts as not only a mnemonic device for myself, but also as an yearbook of some sort &ndash; something I can look back on ten years from now and reminisce about how ignorant I was and realize how much I have grown since those days. We&rsquo;ll see how dedicated I am in keeping this blog up-to-date, but I&rsquo;m genuinely excited to see how my career as a web developer will unfold.</p>

<h4>Aside</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;m actually a big quote guy as well. Here is a quote that really reasonates with me, by the great Mahatma Gandhi and popularized by the equally great Coach John Wooden.</p>
